"""Module defining the foundation of a geometry class hierarchy.

This module introduces the concept of a base class that serves as the
foundation for more specific geometry classes. Even though this class
is empty, it establishes the beginning of an inheritance hierarchy
and demonstrates the principle of starting simple and building complexity.

class BaseGeometry:
    """Base class for all geometry shapes.

    This class serves as the foundation for a geometry class hierarchy.
    While currently empty, it establishes the concept that all geometry
    shapes will share common characteristics and behaviors.

    In object-oriented design, it's common to start with a simple base class
    and gradually add functionality. This approach allows you to:
    1. Establish a common interface for related classes
    2. Add shared functionality as it becomes clear what's needed
    3. Ensure all related classes follow the same basic structure

    Even an empty class has value because it:
    - Inherits from object (Python's base class for everything)
    - Provides a common type that all geometry shapes will share
    - Establishes the inheritance hierarchy for future development

    Future geometry classes like Rectangle, Circle, Triangle will all
    inherit from this class, creating a family of related objects.
